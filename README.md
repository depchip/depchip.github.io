# Welcome to the DepChip website!

This website is built using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our goal is to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for our customers.

To run the website locally, you will need to have a web server and browser installed on your machine. Once you have that set up, you can clone the repository, navigate to the root directory, and start the server.

We've also included a few helpful documentation and links that will guide you through the codebase and explain how certain features have been implemented.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us at info@depchip.com

Thank you from Team DepChip!
